        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This recipe is made with mutton and chicken, but you can easily change the meats for<br> lamb and/or merguez. I make this often and my family loves it!
        </p>

        <h3>Couscous:</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>2 cups couscous</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons harissa</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Season mutton<br> chops and chicken drumsticks with salt and pepper; cook in batches with onions in<br> the hot oil until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate.</li>
            <li>Scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to release browned bits. Return<br> mutton chops and chicken to the pot. Pour in enough water to cover; add turmeric,<br> cumin, and coriander. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium;<br> simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir potatoes, turnips, and carrots into the pot. Simmer, covered, until vegetables<br> start to soften, about 10 minutes. Mix in tomato paste and ras el hanout; cook <br>for 10 minutes. Stir in chickpeas, zucchini, and cilantro; continue cooking, covered,<br> until zucchini is tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a saucepan; remove from heat and stir in couscous<br> and butter. Cover saucepan and let stand until water is absorbed completely, 5 to 10<br> minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork and stir in 1 tablespoon olive oil. Transfer<br> to a serving dish.</li>
            <li>Ladle 2 scoops of cooking liquid into a bowl; mix in harissa until smooth.</li>
            <li>Scoop vegetables onto a serving plate. Scoop mutton and chicken onto a separate plate.<br> Serve alongside couscous, harissa sauce, and remaining cooking liquid in the pot.</li>
